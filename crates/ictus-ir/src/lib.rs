//! Frontends (Verilog, later SystemVerilog/VHDL) lower their ASTs into this

//!
//! v1 scope (deliberately narrow -- see docs/decisions.md for the
//! interpreter-first sequencing this supports): a single flat module, no
//! instances/hierarchy, no parameters/generate blocks, any number of
//! clocked (`always @(posedge clk)`) processes and continuous `assign`s
//! but no `always_comb` yet, `if`/`else` (no `else if`) and non-blocking
//! assignment only, no `case`, no bit-select/concatenation. Each of those
//! is a documented gap to widen incrementally, not a final design.
